# Please Work my Friend

You have just learned the **basics of Docusaurus** and made some changes to the **initial template**.

Docusaurus has **much more to offer**!

Have **5 more minutes**? Take a look at **[versioning](../tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions.mdx)** and **[i18n](../tutorial-extras/translate-your-site.mdx)**.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/4610)

## What's next?

* Find inspirations in the [Docusaurus showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase)
* Get involved in the [Docusaurus Community](https://docusaurus.io/community/support)
